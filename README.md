# Flowgraph
Flowgraph is a tool to modify MIDI events in real-time.
Completely powered by plugins compiled at startup. There was some very expermaintal code that compiled the current state, with plugins into a single exe.

A few ways it can be used:
- Debug MIDI events.
- Transpose notes.
- Simulate Sostenuto, Sustain, Soft piano pedals.
- Split a single MIDI source to different channels or different outputs.



Flowgraph started out as a general purpose scripted plugin system, it ended up only being used to process MIDI events.
