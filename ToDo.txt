There 'should' be no bugs or 'clean-ups' before moving to the next 'step'.
The objects can be added at anytime. But be aware there could be changes that will brake objects.

####BUGS####
	Does not load joystick device.


####Clean-Ups#### <Means make things orderly and comment things.

Step#1
	
Step#2
	
	Change size and pos of the BaseObject to client sizes/pos.  (Rect, Setup(,,Width,Height))
		That way things can change with out it messing-up objects.
	
	Allow objects to send Requests for new data from a input. (Object1 is connected to Object2 and Object2 wants a update so it asks object1.)
	
	Add support for C# plugins
		Im thinking of just having a libary named csPlugins.dll

Step#3

	Compile saved config file with plugins. as a single (.exe or .dll)    (with a option to disable all GUI)

	Add the abllty to save a config file for objects. ****There may not really be a need for this****
		e.g. Save the text of DisplayAsString so you could load it later.


	Change the Dots(inputs, outputs) to arrows pointing the way.


Step#4
	SimpleD needs support for groups inside groups. (for folders)

	Folders (Allow you to put objects in folders.)
			Each folder would have one input(As Object) and one output(As Object).




Objects to add:   **There should be atleast one object scripted in C#.** (After step#2 is Done.)
	Math:
		Minus
		Round
		Multiply
		Devide

	Logic:
		Equals	In(Object1,Object2)		Out(Equals|Boolean)
		Numbers:
			Greater Then
			Less Than
			Greater Than or equal to
			Less Than or equal to 

	Misc:
		Get varable from object.

	Input:
		Keyboard:	In(Enabled, Tick)	Out(Keyboard state, Down)
		Mouse:		In(Enabled, Tick)	Out(Position, DownButtons, UpButtons)
		Joystick:	In(Enabled, Tick, Joystick ID) Out(Joystick state)
		InputHandler: In(Input)		Out(InputState, Axis, IsPressed)

	Output:
		


	MIDI:
		Still need to figerout how channels are going to be handled.
			I may just have a All check box then when unchecked you could set a channel?

		Input device	In(Enabled, DeviceID)			Out(MidiMessage)
		Output device	In(Enabled, DeviceID, MidiMessage)
		Controller		In(Controller, InputHandler)	Out(MidiMessage)
		AlterNote		In(MidiMessage, SustainInput, SostenutoInput, SoftInput) Out(MidiMessage)
