There 'should' be no bugs or 'clean-ups' before moving to the next 'step'.
The objects can be added at anytime. But be aware there could be changes that will brake objects.

####BUGS####
	Not a full bug but it should be fixed. At somepoint.
		Menu currently draws when ever you move the mouse. Even if nothing changed.
		Tooltip calls the draw when I don't think it needs to be.

####Clean-Ups#### <Means make things orderly and comment things.

Step#1
	
Step#2
	
	Change size and pos of the BaseObject to client sizes/pos.  (Rect, Setup(,,Width,Height))
		That way things can change with out it messing-up objects.
	
	Allow objects to send Requests for new data from a input. (Object1 is connected to Object2 and Object2 wants a update so it asks object1.)
	
	Add support for C# plugins
		Im thinking of just having a libary named csPlugins.dll

Step#3
	Sort menu items by name.

	Compile saved config file with plugins. as a single (.exe or .dll)    (with a option to disable all GUI)


	Change the Dots(inputs, outputs) to arrows pointing the way.


Step#4
	SimpleD needs support for groups inside groups. (for folders)

	Folders (Allow you to put objects in folders.)
			Each folder would have one input(As Object) and one output(As Object).




Objects to add:   **There should be atleast one object scripted in C#.** (After step#2 is Done.)
	Math:
		Minus
		Round
		Multiply
		Devide

	Logic:
		Equals	In(Object1,Object2)		Out(Equals,Boolean)
		Numbers:
			Greater Then
			Less Than
			Greater Than or equal to
			Less Than or equal to 

	Misc:
		Get varable from object.

	Input:
		Keyboard:	In(Enabled, Tick)	Out(Keyboard state, Down)
		Mouse:		In(Enabled, Tick)	Out(Position, DownButtons, UpButtons)
		Joystick:	In(Enabled, Tick, Joystick ID) Out(Joystick state)
		InputHandler: In(Input)		Out(InputState, Axis, IsPressed)

	Output:
		


	MIDI:
		GetController
		GetNote
		Debug	Like Pedals debug.
		Input:
			Add a checkbox to 'fix' controller events. (Mainly note On and Off.)

		Keyboard:
			Add a check box to disable other channel colors.
